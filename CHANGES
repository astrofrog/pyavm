CHANGES
-------

Version 0.9.4

    Properly extract scale and rotation for arbitrary WCS objects.

Version 0.9.3

    Fix compatibility with Python 3.

    Add a keyword argument ``xmp_packet_index`` in AVM.from_image, which can
    be used to indicate which XMP packet to load if there are multiple ones.

Version 0.9.2

    Fix compatibility with latest Astropy version. AVM.from_wcs now requires an
    image shape to be passed to set Spatial.ReferenceDimension, for recent
    versions of Astropy. [#28]

Version 0.9.1

    Allow AVM meta-data to be read from any file format by simply searching
    for the XMP packet by scanning the file contents.

Version 0.9.0

    Complete re-factoring. Embedding for PNG and JPEG is now
    standard-compliant. Initialization from headers, WCS objects, and images
    is now done via class methods (see README.md).

Version 0.1.4

    Now write XMP packet using ElementTree to ensure XML compliance

Version 0.1.3

    Rewrote XML parsing using ElementTree. Compact XMP tags are now read
    properly. All example images parse without errors.

Version 0.1.2

    Added support for embedding AVM meta-data in TIF files

Version 0.1.1

    Added support for embedding AVM meta-data in JPG and PNG files, and
    added methods to create AVM container from WCS or FITS header
    information.
